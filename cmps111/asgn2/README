Special Note(s)
-------------------------- 
After consulting with Dr Long, we did not use a shared repo on Git.
Instead, we pair-programmed our final implementations on the team 
captains computer (Tims) and used the other computers as multiple 
testing environments for building and compiling different kernel 
versions.  

Due to the complexity of this project, the pseudo-code in our DesignDoc 
heavily focuses on the additions or changes we made to the default 
kernel in order to implement a lottery scheduler.

Edited files

Test programs and other files:
--------------------------
fork_bomb.c
write_bomb.c
Makefile
README
DESIGN.pdf 

--------------------------
Build/Run Instructions:
-------------------------- 
1. Use 'make ' to create 'fork_bomb' and 'write_bomb' executables.
2. 'fork_bomb' takes in a single INT.  
2. 'write_bomb' takes in an IN file and an OUT file.  
Note: 'make clean' removes executables, 'in', 'out' (used in testing).

--------------------------
Test Instructions:
--------------------------
After building using the 'make' command: 
Test 1: ./fork_bomb 10000000 > in
Test 2: ./write_bomb in out
The first test will print out the contents of the two files to standard
out while test 2 will print the contents of test1.txt to standard out 
and then exit with an error message.
