Copy all of the files in this directory into the student's
directory.  For each point deduction, give a reason.  Numbers in
parens are the max points for each check.

Grade only one partner's code and assign them the same score.

*****************************************************************

SOURCE CODE.

     Run mk.build

     (3) Checksource was silent, did not complain.  No extra
	 files were submitted, except as per asgt spec.
         Header files must end with .h and implementation files
         with either .cc or .cpp.

     (3) Used good consistent indentation.  Did not use any
	 one-letter idents, used only meaningful idents.
-1 questionable indentation and spacing
     (3) In both commands.cc(cpp) and inode.cc(cpp), used a throw to
         report errors, which is caught in main().

     In the module commands.cc(cpp):  Check for reasonable code and a
     proper implementation of:

     (3) fn_cd, fn_echo, fn_exit, fn_prompt, fn_pwd

     (3) fn_cat, fn_make, fn_makedir

     (3) fn_ls, fn_lsr

     (3) fn_rm, fn_rmr

     In inode.cc(cpp):  Check for reasonable code in:

     (3) readfile, writefile

     (3) mkdir, mkfile (but it is also OK if these are done
         in the constructor instead.

     (3) Proper additions to inode_state

*****************************************************************

PROGRAM TESTING:

     (3) If gmake failed, try to compile manually with:
         g++ -o yshell *.cc >compile.log 2>&1
         g++ -o yshell *.cpp >compile.log 2>&1
         If that worked, deduct these three 3 points.
         If not, assign 0 for this section.

     Run mk.tests
     Check each test run *.out and *.err for the expected output.

     (4) test0.ysh
-1 incorrect prompt (double space)
     (4) test1.ysh

     (4) test2.ysh
-1 cat performs strangely (prints first and last, but not 
middle???)
     (4) test3.ysh
-2 lsr does not work correctly
     (4) test4.ysh

     Other checks.

     (2) Deduct 2 points if the valgrind test indicated memory
         leaks, invalid memory references, or any other complaint.
-2 memory leaks
     (5) Deduct 3 points here if any test run seg faulted,
         dumped core, or otherwise terminated abnormally.
         Deduct 5 points if more than one test did so.

testing points: 24/30
